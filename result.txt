=== MEMORY SEGMENT BOUNDARIES ===

--- STACK SEGMENT (Cross-function comparison) ---
Value of parentAddr: 0x7ffccb0c7aa4
Address of childVar: 0x7ffccb0c7a84
Stack grows: DOWN

--- TEXT SEGMENT (Code) ---
Address of main(): 0x56dbc13e9357
Address of checkStack(): 0x56dbc13e9209

--- DATA SEGMENT (Initialized Globals) ---
Value of globalInt1: 100
Address of globalInt1: 0x56dbc13ec010
Value of globalInt2: 150
Address of globalInt2: 0x56dbc13ec014

--- BSS SEGMENT (Uninitialized Globals) ---
Value of globalInt3: 0
Address of globalInt3: 0x56dbc13ec154
Value of globalInt4: 0
Address of globalInt4: 0x56dbc13ec158

--- HEAP SEGMENT (Dynamic Allocation) ---
Address of heapVar1: 0x56dbeceaf2b0
Address of heapVar2: 0x56dbeceaf6c0
Heap grows: UP

=== RELATIVE POSITION SUMMARY ===
The STACK is at a HIGHER address than the HEAP.
The HEAP is at a HIGHER address than the STATIC segment.
